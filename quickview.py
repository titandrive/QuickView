"""QuickView — a macOS Quick Look style previewer for KDE.

Usage: quickview <file> [file ...]
       quickview --daemon       run resident (systemd user service does this)
       quickview --clear-cache  empty the disk preview cache

Keys:
  Space / Esc / Q   close the preview
  Left / Right      previous / next file (the selection if several files
                    were passed, otherwise siblings in the same folder)
  Enter             open the file in its default application

A second invocation while a preview is open is forwarded to the running
instance: same file toggles the window closed (like Quick Look), a
different file switches the preview.
