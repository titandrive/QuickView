"""User settings, read from ~/.config/quickview/quickview.conf.

Deliberately small. Everything here is a *preference* — something a person
might reasonably want different. The many other constants in quickview.py
are safety bounds on untrusted input (frame sizes, frame counts, timeouts);
exposing those would turn a config file into a way to defeat the sandbox's
limits, so they stay in the code.

INI rather than TOML because tomllib is Python 3.11 and this project
supports 3.10. Precedence is environment variable, then file, then default:
the env var stays useful for trying a setting without editing anything.

Read once at startup. The daemon is resident, so changing the file takes
effect on:

    systemctl --user restart quickview.service
